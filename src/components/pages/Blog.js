      <p>🚀 Let’s Build Together: Why Squad Projects Matter
Hey devs, tech enthusiasts, and curious minds — welcome to the start of something special! As a Full Stack MERN Developer, I’ve built solo projects, explored new tech stacks, and crushed bugs deep into the night (dark mode gang, you know the vibe). But now I’m taking on a new challenge: building real-world projects with a dev squad — virtually or IRL — and documenting every step right here.</p>

       <p>🎯 What is “Let’s Build Together” About?
This blog series is about collaboration, transparency, and leveling up together. In every post, I’ll share:

The concept behind each project

Squad planning and task distribution

Real coding challenges (and how we slay them)

GitHub links, demos, and deploys

Lessons learned along the way

Whether you’re a beginner just getting started with the MERN stack or a seasoned dev looking to connect and contribute, this space is for you.</p>

<p>👨‍💻 Why Projects in Squad?
Solo dev work builds muscle. Squad work builds endurance. From code reviews to late-night debugging, real teamwork teaches communication, ownership, and empathy — plus, it’s just more fun.

Together, we’ll:

Build apps with purpose

Write cleaner, scalable code

Learn from each other’s strengths

Get comfortable with “I don’t know — let’s figure it out!”</p>

<p>🧠 What’s Coming Up?
Next, we’ll brainstorm and vote on our first project: Should we build a task manager? A real-time chat app? A DevTo-style blogging platform? The options are endless — and the adventure starts now.

👋 Stay tuned for the next post where we choose our first squad project, break it into modules, and kick off the dev sprint!</p>
